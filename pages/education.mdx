Starting at the age of eight, I have had a deep passion for horse riding and have been consistently involved in the sport. In 2018, I obtained my certification as a coach from the Polish Equestrian Association, and for two years, I worked as an instructor in a horse riding school. This role provided me with valuable experience in working with people, including communicating with participants, tailoring lessons to their individual abilities, and providing feedback to help them improve their riding skills.
