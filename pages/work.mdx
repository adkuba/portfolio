I worked in the Meedy team responsible for healthcare systems. I was maintaining and developing new functionalities and microservices related to, arranging appointments with doctors, managing medical facilities and sending medical documentation to the National Health Fund.

**Notifications** - One of the microservices I developed was the new notification microservice. This microservice played a key role in enabling the sending of a large number of emails and SMSes from all the services in our stack. Its effectiveness was demonstrated during the COVID-19 health survey conducted for the abcZdrowie platform, which had over 200,000 participants and required sending a high volume of emails.

**Logging** - I also implemented a microservice specialized in logging all the changes from our administration service. This microservice allowed our clients to review the changes and prevent data loss. We were able to provide an extra layer of security and transparency for our clients, ensuring that any changes made to their data were traceable and easily reviewable.
