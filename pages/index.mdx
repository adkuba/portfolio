In my master's studies, I've dived into data preprocessing for my thesis, sparking a real passion for AI. Attending international conferences has not only broadened my horizons but also intensified my belief in AI's power to revolutionize technology and research.

Beyond technology, I am a certified horse riding coach. This role has allowed me to share my passion for equestrian sports. I also enjoy running, which I find to be a great way to clear my mind and stay fit.
